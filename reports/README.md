# Test Reports

This folder contains exported test reports intended to be committed to the repository as part of the assignment deliverables.

- `playwright-html/` — Playwright HTML report (static files)
- `junit.xml` — JUnit-style test results

To regenerate locally:

- Run: `npx playwright test`
- Then copy the generated `playwright-report/` and `test-results/junit.xml` into this folder.
